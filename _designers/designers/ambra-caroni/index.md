Ambra Caroni born, raised and proud of being Italian, takes her first steps into Fashion Design starting in London her BA. The relationship that she shows with designing could be described as an healthy obsession yet controversial love, but never short of passion.

Ambra is really attached to her routes and tries to transmit this into her work, but never with the same "package". Indeed her "Rorschach" graduation collection is ambitious and peculiar with fluid lines and sheer fabrics used carefully to provide to each of the pieces a very special character. The key in her work is the idea of luxury but never too pretentious.Ambra collaborated in the development of AW 2013 collection of Spanish Designer Conchita Perez and with various stylists and magazines such as "Grazia Italia".She graduates in BA Fashion Design by Heriot-Watt University in collaboration with West London College and is currently collaborating with Jonathan Saunders Studio in London.
