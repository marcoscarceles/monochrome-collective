Originating from Kundian, Mianwali, Ayesha was born and brought up in Rawalpinidi, Pakistan. She moved to the UK in 2008. After attending a few short courses related to Fashion, Photography and Make-up at London College of Fashion, she continued her studies in 2011.

Going through a visible transition and learning from basics her initial work comprised of ‘Fashion and Memory’ where she fused her Pakistani heritage to a very modern and British approach. Simultaneously  ‘Grace and Mabel’, a client based project, gave a hands on experience in dealing with customers and their needs.

Embarking on the Final Major Project ‘Eclectic Regality’, Ayesha took an entirely different approach. There is a visible transition that runs through the collection giving each piece an individual identity. In 2013 Ayesha worked with a Spanish Designer Conchita Perez, for her A/W 2013 collection ‘The Man Who Wanted To Be Kind’.

Since 2012, Ayesha has actively been a part of the Organizing Team at Pakistan Fashion Week London. She also worked for Celements Rebiero and Fashion Retrospective at London Fashion Week S/S 2013.
