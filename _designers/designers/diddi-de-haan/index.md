Born and raised in Link&ouml;ping Sweden by Dutch parents Diddi had a rich cultural heritage to use as inspiration from the moment she was born. Later deciding to seek adventures abroad by moving to the ever pulsating city London she enrolled in fashion studies to further explore her creative abilities.

Finding her creative style came quickly with stylish designs and experimental shapes. Drawing a strong style sense from the Swedish fashion scene, she combines this with a quirky, odd twists to the garments that keeps them fun and interesting. 

Three years on in London and graduating with a BA in fashion design from Heriot Watt University is the next step in this fashion adventure. More travelling and life experiences will feed and nurture future collections that she wishes to share with people all around her! The next step is to push fashion boundaries more and explore the world through her fashion creations.
