Monochrome Collective Launch Event 
==================================

On the evening of the 16th of June we are taking a Monochromic approach at our Launch Event, A night like no other, where eclectic fashion will let you express yourself.

The evening will start with you being able to travel through our work process, from the start of exploring the structure of an iceberg all the way to how to play with pretty pleats. The exhibition will give you an opportunity to see first-hand how a collection is made and how the minds of our designers creates.

You will be carried through with a DJ who will follow the beat of the crowd and set the scene as you also get the chance to purchase whatever catches your eye.Your mind  will be filled of imagination after this event, come and join us for a night to remember!.

**And do not forget you monochrome outfit to enjoy you complementary drink with us!**
